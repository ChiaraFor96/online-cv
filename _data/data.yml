          In my role within the [Business Intelligence Group](https://big.csr.unibo.it/), 
          I focused on querying heterogeneous static and streaming data within 
          a data analysis platform. 
          This involved the entire process, from the formalization of concepts to the implementation 
          and rigorous testing of the proposed solutions.
          Additionally, I contributed to the development of a real-time data platform 
          for monitoring and analyzing the brown marmorated 
          stink bug population in Northern Italy, accessible at [Cimice.net](https://big.csr.unibo.it/projects/cimice/monitoring.php).
          My work also included developing a big data platform leveraging Docker Swarm.
